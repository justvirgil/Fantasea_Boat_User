## About The Project

<div align="left">

<pre>
This is the first mobile application I made and was done to demonstrate the utilization of CRUD that was presented later as a project.

It works like a booking application where a pump-boat user needs to press a queue button that would enable the client to see them as someone that is available to be book with along with the details.

I also have the client user application in different repository =)

<strong>Both applications runs differently.</strong>
